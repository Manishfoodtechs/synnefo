    Helper manager to validate a server action and handle quota commission.

    1) Check if action can be performed. If it can, then there must be no
       pending task (with the exception of DESTROY).
    2) Handle previous commission if unresolved:
       * If it is not pending and it to accept, then accept
       * If it is not pending and to reject or is pending then reject it. Since
       the action can be performed only if there is no pending task, then there
       can be no pending commission. The exception is DESTROY, but in this case
       the commission can safely be rejected, and the dispatcher will generate
       the correct ones!
    3) Issue new commission and associate it with the VM. Also clear the task.
